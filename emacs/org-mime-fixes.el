;;; Commentary:

;; This file is supposed to fix some incenveniences in org-mime package.  It
;; adds <br> tags to newlines in html blockquotes if there is only one of them.
;; Remove file:// from src blocks.  For some reason (I think it is the usage
;; regexp without saving the match-data) it gets added twice.  It modifies the
;; behaviour of org-mime-edit-src.  Doesn't add the signature to it.

;;; Code:
